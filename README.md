# jwttoken

JSON Web Token taken from [jwt token](https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt) for Android.

Since jwttoken uses jackson library internally, problem arises when we wanted to use this library in other projects that also uses jackson library.There may be other solution out there, for now this is my solution.
